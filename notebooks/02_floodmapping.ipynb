If we know its cause, it is easy to logically deduce the probability of an effect. However, in this case we want to deduce the probability of a cause from an observed effect, also known as \"reversed probability\". In the case of flood mapping, we have $\\sigma^0$ backscatter observations over land (the effect) and we want to deduce the probability of flooding ($F$) and non-flooding ($NF$). \n",

Of course, these are the figures we've been trying to find this whole time. We don't actually have them yet, so what can we do? In Bayesian statistics, we can just start with our best guess. These guesses are called our \"priors\", because they are the beliefs we hold *prior* to looking at the data.
