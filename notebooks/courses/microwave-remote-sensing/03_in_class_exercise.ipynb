    "\n",
    "Level 1 SAR data, such as the “GRD” product only takes into account the ellipsoidal model of the earth (i.e. slant-range distortion; script Chapter 4), without the description of the relief. This makes mountains appear to lean towards the radar system as visible in the below plot of the GRD scene. This latter distortion originates from the side-looking geometry of the SAR system. Due to this, the radar pulse reaches mountain slope facing the sensor before it reaches the base. Consequently, these slopes appear compressed and leaning toward the sensor. During processing to a level 1C product, these slant range distortions are partly corrected using a terrain correction algorithm and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The most common algorithm for this is the Range Doppler Terrain Correction.\n",

    "When comparing $\\gamma^0_E$ and $\\gamma^0_T$ in the plot we can clearly see the impact of the radiometric correction in the mountainous areas. This correction is necessary, because for slopes facing towards the sensor, a larger ground area contributes to the backscatter value of a slant range resolution cell, than for slopes lying in the opposite direction. This results in significant brightness changes, where foreshortening areas appear brighter and lengthening areas darker. $\\gamma^0_T$ adjusts the backscatter to represent what it would be if the terrain was flat, thus reducing these effects. This significantly reduces the impact of the terrain on the backscatter values, allowing for more accurate comparisons across different terrain types and locations. The correction is done by using a DEM to determine the local illuminated area at each radar position. The above illustrated approach is also referred to as terrain flattening because in the resulting image, mountains appear flat. As $\\gamma^0_T$ is corrected for geometric and radiometric distortions, it is also referred to as Normalized Radar Backscatter (NRB) and is the current standard for Analysis-Ready-Backscatter (ARD)."
