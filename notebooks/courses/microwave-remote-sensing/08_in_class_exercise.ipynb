    "On July 5th, 2019, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 mainshock struck eastern California, near the city of Ridgecrest. The seismic event produced a surface rupture spanning more than 50 kilometers with a complex vertical and horizontal offset pattern along the main fault line.\n",
    "SAR imagery can be employed for accurately measuring and describing ground motion through a well-established technique called SAR Interferometry. In this framework, the **phase** information contained in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is employed. In this notebook, we will dive into the main interferometric SAR processing operations which involves retrieving the difference between the phase signals of repeated SAR acquisitions to analyze the shape and deformation of the Earth's surface. In our case, we will use a pair of Single Look Complex (SLC) Sentinel-1 images to obtain an interferogram of the Ridgecrest earthquake.\n",

    "\n",
    "The interferogram formation process combines the amplitudes of both images and calculates the difference between their respective phases at each SAR image pixel (cross-multiplication of the master image with the complex conjugate of the slave image).\n",
    "\n",
    "After building up the interferogram, we have to take into account the presence of other contributing terms that could hinder our goal of measuring the surface deformation due to the earthquake. For example, we need to subtract from the interferogram the flat-earth phase contribution, which is a signal contribution due to the curvature of the Earth's surface.\n",
    "This is here done automatically through the SNAP software operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the accuracy of interferometric measurements are influenced by many contributors that could result in a loss of **coherence**. But what is coherence? It is a measure of phase correlation between the master and slave image.\n",
    "Interferometric coherence (γ) can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$γ = γ_{proc}*γ_{geom}*γ_{vol}*γ_{SNR}*γ_{temp}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $γ_{proc}$ refers to inaccuracies in the processing (e.g., coregistration errors), $γ_{geom}$ refers to the baseline decorrelation (different position of satellites during the two acquisitions), $γ_{vol}$ refers to volume decorrelation (vegetation related), $γ_{SNR}$ refers to the radar instrument thermal noise and $γ_{temp}$ refers to the decorrelation caused by change of position of the objects in the scene during the time interval of the images acquisitions (e.g., plant growth, wind-induced movements or ground deformation due to earthquakes, landslides).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that interferometric accuracy is sensitive to many processes, hence isolating the ground deformation signal involves several operations. On the other hand, interferometric coherence sensitivity could be exploited to track and map phenomena that cause its degradation (e.g., vegetation features, and water content).\n"

Along the earthquake fault line, low coherence between the two phase acquisitions is visible. This occurs due to extreme changes in terrain heights or displacements, which are beyond the sensitivity of the SAR sensor. This area of low coherence indicates higher uncertainty in the interferogram. However, this isn't necessarily a drawback, as it helps to clearly identify the earthquake epicenter.\n",

Each fringe cycle (e.g., from red to red or blue to blue) corresponds to ground motion in this case. The fringe patterns indicate motion in the line-of-sight (LOS) of the satellite (Sentinel-1 has a mean incidence angle of 38°) in terms of either uplift (relative motion of the ground towards the satellite) or sinking (relative motion of the ground away from the satellite).\n",
    "If the interferogram phase changes from 0 to -3.14 (cycles in the negative direction), the surface is moving away from the satellite (i.e., sinking movement). Vice versa, if cycles go in the positive direction (from 0 to +3.14), it would mean a relative uplifting movement of the ground.\n",
