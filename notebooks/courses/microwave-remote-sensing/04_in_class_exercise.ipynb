    "In this notebook we discuss how we can easily compare images of two or more different time slices, satellites or other earth observation products. We limit our selves to products on a regular grid with an associated coordinate reference system (CRS), known as a raster. This means that each cell of the raster contains an attribute value and location coordinates. The process of combining such rasters to form datacubes is called raster stacking. We can have datacubes in many forms, such as the spatiotemporal datacube:\n",

    "$$Z = f(x,y,t) \\quad \\text{,}$$\n",
    "\n",
