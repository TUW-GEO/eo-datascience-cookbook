    "$$\n",
    "D =  10  \\cdot \\log_{10} (I) = 10 \\cdot \\log_{10} (e) \\cdot \\ln (I)\\longrightarrow [dB]\n",

    "Similarly, the conversion back to the original unit can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = e^{\\frac{D}{10\\cdot \\log_{10}(e)}} = 10^{\\frac{D}{10}} \\longrightarrow [m^2m^{-2}]\n",

    "When performing mathematical operations with SAR data it is important to be aware, that adding values in the logarithmic scale doesn't work in the same way as adding regular (linear) values. This is because in the logarithmic scale, each unit step represents an equal multiplication. This means that an addition of two values in the logarithmic scale equals a multiplication of the values in the linear scale. Vice versa, a subtraction in a logarithmic scale equals a division in a linear scale. Let's have a look at an example, where we add two values, once without the conversion to linear scale and once with the conversion to linear scale.\n"
