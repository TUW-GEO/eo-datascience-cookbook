    "Remember that longer wavelengths like L-bands are more likely to penetrate through a forest canopy and would interact more readily with larger object like tree trunks and the forest floor. In turn, C-band microwaves are more likely to interact with sparse and shrub vegetation. The polarization of the emitted and received microwaves is on the other hand dependent on the type of backscattering with co-polarization (HH and VV) happening more frequently with direct backscatter or double bounce scattering. Whereas volume scattering occurs when the radar signal is subject to multiple reflections within 3-dimensional matter, as the orientation of the main scatterers is random, the polarization of the backscattered signal is also random. Volume scattering can therefore cause an increase of cross-polarized intensity.\n",

To get a better feel for these changes over time we generate the following interactive plot.

This might indicate the effect of volume scattering in forested areas where co- and cross-polarization render backscattering values more equal. You will study the differences among cross- and co-polarized backscattering in more detail in the homework exercise."
